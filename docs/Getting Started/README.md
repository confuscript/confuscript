# Getting Started

To get started with Confuscript, all you need to do is install the CLI. Confuscript doesn't use 
any fancy binaries or anything.

For NPM:
`npm i @confuscript/cli -g`

For Yarn:
`yarn global add @confuscript/cli`

The CLI uses the command `co`. You can read more about the CLI [here](/packages/cli/README.md)
