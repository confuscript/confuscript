# Confuscript

Confuscript is a programming language written in TypeScript. It is unique because it offers the following features:
 - Multiple "entry points" (targets) to build one code base in several different ways
   - Allows one codebase for a server, cli, library, etc
 - Automatic optimisation since the compiler knows the intent of all of your code to output a cut-down and optimised version to keep it as big and as fast as it needs to be

Confuscripts name is very confusing... which is why its called confuscript. It isn't a script (but gets that because it borrows a lot of script-like language features from ECMA). It gets the confused part because its **confu**sed

## Coming in the future:
 - Automatic compilation of web and server code (like Next.JS but for confuscript)
    - Automatic API generation based on what code is used where
